### Project Description
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an automated car parking system that can efficiently manage the entry and exit of vehicles in a parking facility. By utilizing Arduino microcontrollers and IR sensors, we aim to create a cost-effective and user-friendly solution that can be easily deployed in different environments.

### The Problem statement
Design and implement an automated car parking system using Arduino and IR sensors to efficiently manage vehicle entry and exit in a parking facility. The system should be able to detect incoming and outgoing vehicles using IR sensors, automatically open and close the gate using a servo motor, and display the number of available parking slots on an LCD screen in real-time. The goal is to develop a cost-effective and user-friendly automated car parking system that ensures efficient management of vehicle entry and exit, providing real-time updates on parking slot availability.

### Setup and Configuration 
1. Connect the IR sensors to digital pins 2 and 3 on the Arduino board.
2. Connect the servo motor to a PWM pin (e.g., pin 9) on the Arduino board.
3. Connect the LCD screen to the Arduino board using the I2C protocol.
4. Upload the provided Arduino code to the board.

## How it Works
1. The IR sensors detect incoming and outgoing vehicles.
2. The Arduino board reads the sensor inputs and controls the servo motor to open or close the gate.
3. The LCD screen displays the number of available parking slots in real-time.
4. The system updates the available parking slots count based on vehicle entry and exit.
